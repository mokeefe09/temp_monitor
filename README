Temperature Monitor Project

Digital temperature representation is derived from the resistance of a thermistor 
in a voltage divider circuit. Simple logic is then performed to determine if the
temperature has exceeded a maximum temperature threshold. If so, a piezo buzzer is
sounded using pulse-width modulation on a GPIO pin and a warning message appears
on the LCD. If the temperature is equal to or below the threshold, the piezo buzzer
does not sound and the temperature is displayed in Fahrenheit on the LCD.

This is a bare-metal project. Each driver was made from scratch, with the exception
of the LCD driver, which was adapted from a driver available in an online tutorial
by Mike Silva at EmbeddedRelated.com. The name of the article in which the driver
appears is "Introduction to Microcontrollers - Adding Some Real-World Hardware".
